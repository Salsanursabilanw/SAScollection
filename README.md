# SAScollection
These are the collection of SAS Syntax that I have used in my college years. One of them helps me to graduate and publish my first paper. 
For me, using SAS is somewhat comfortable because I can do it online in whatever device because I have my SAS Studio account. I recommend using SAS for time series analysis because the syntax is so easy to learn and you can always looking for code you need in SAS Support

So, when I had a challenging time having to code a new test that I just learnt, I would go to SAS/ETS and found not only the syntax, but also how to use them, examples, how to interpret the output, and more information about the test. It is really convenient.
For the VECM syntax result you can check it in my paper published by IOP Publishing [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1751/1/012016)
